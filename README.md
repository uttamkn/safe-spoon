# Safe Spoon
Safe Spoon is a web application that helps users determine if a food product is safe to consume based on their personal health factors. By uploading an image of the food or its ingredient list and specifying their allergies, age, weight, gender, and other relevant health information, users can receive immediate feedback on potential health risks.
